1) instead of using a separate timer, check how the existing delta timer works by having it print out

2) dynamic texture swap.  setup a second texture and have each actor use a different texture.  every five seconds, swap the textures, and see if it works that easily.  also tests for if textureBuffers can be reused.

3) test key presses.  what happens if the window is not in focus?  what happens if the user is typing in the address bar?

4) test mobile view.  what happens, period.  what happens when landscape orientation is switched to. is there a way to lock to landscape orientation in a browser?

5) test mouse clicks.  are those different from finger taps?  test those too.
