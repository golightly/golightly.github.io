create a button to connect as host and a text field for username, a clickable list of hosts. a button to join selected host

below these is a text field and a button for sending messages, and an area where recieved messages appear

set a max number of hosts on the server (100?)



host submits their name and password for their lobby, the number of people who can join NOT including themselves, and an sdp array of that size.

the server checks the number of existing hosts, and if there's too many, sends back a rejection message

the server runs the host name through a filter, then adds all the submitted info to a new host object in an array of host objects

it also adds the time that the object was created at

the server is running a timer and every hour it checks through all the host data and if that object was created more than an hour ago, it is erased

change close lobby button to disconnect from lobby and make it for everyone (if the host clicks it, it sends a signal to the server to close the lobby, if it still exists.  the lobby is also closed automatically if it is filled to max size)

1) connection setup
2) initial sdp

when a client leaves the lobby after connecting, while the lobby is still open, the host removes that connection, creates a new object, sends an object to the server to be used by a client who wants to join in place of the previous client, with an index explaining where in the server's array to place it
