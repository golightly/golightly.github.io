changes: host has to select lobby maximum size

try sending an object with the name and the description in json form instead of sdp

added close lobby button, but server uses a timer to automatically close after 30min

server will only accept a maximum of 500 hosts at any one time

host:

1) host sends name and password (optional) to server, along with lobby maximum size. 
creates maximum number of possible connections and sends all connection data to server

2) server checks if name is unique against records of all current names being stored

3) returns an ok message or an error message to host

4) server updates list of hosts
