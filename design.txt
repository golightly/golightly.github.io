level up at ie. 10, 30, 60, 100, 150, 210, add 10 to previous level up amount


going forward:

If you did a little more with it. Add the tool tips, add better art (you can even look into some royalty free stuff as this isn't a paid app)
give some enemy varation

Well the other stuff add better enemy variations, maybe some boss enemies for each dungeon level instead of just "goblin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8"
